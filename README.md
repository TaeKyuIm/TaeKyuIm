In transfer learning and fine tuning task, there is a problem that which layer should be freezed and unfreezed. My Research topic is find which layer should be fine tunned by neural network parameter analysis. With my research topic, I can apply many open source neural network structure. Recently, the main objective is to apply the research topic to PEFT techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA.
