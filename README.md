## Interest
I'm very interested in Autonomous Agent based AI, especially LLM, LMM. In manufacturing area, it is important build AI Agent with ANI(Artificial Narrow Intelligence). With my research topic, I can build AI specific to my project with fine tuning to open source model by fitting strictly(No network needed). I want to solve many complex and abstract problem with Agent based on AI specific to my project.

## Research Topic: Neural Network Training Dynamics

In transfer learning and fine tuning task, there is a problem that which layer should be freezed and unfreezed. My Research topic is find which layer should be fine tunned by neural network parameter analysis. With my research topic, I can apply many open source neural network structure. Recently, the main objective is to apply the research topic to PEFT techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA.
